# Spy-network-

**Overview**
This project models a network of intelligence agents and their communications. It is written in Java and developed step by step to introduce concepts of classes, encapsulation, testing, and secure message handling.

Agents have identifying information such as a name, code name, and unique ID. They can send and receive messages, which can be stored in inboxes. As the program develops, messages can be encoded, encrypted, and decrypted, and security clearances are used to restrict communication.

Features

- Agent management with unique IDs and code names.

- Clearance levels to model security restrictions.

- Messaging system where agents can send and receive messages.

- Inbox for storing and reading messages in order.

- Encoding & encryption of messages using simple ciphers.

- Decryption with key checking.

- Secret agents with private inboxes and clearance-based communication rules.
